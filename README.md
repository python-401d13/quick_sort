## Challenge Description
Write a blog detailing the QuickSort algorithm. Trace some examples so readers can see details of the QuickSort algorithm. Practice writing an exaplanation.

## Approach & Efficiency
The QuickSort algorithm is made of up three functions. The main function of the QuickSort algorithm is a QuickSort function which sorts a list at an abstract level. The QuickSort function uses a Partition function to find the pivot of a list where on the left all values are less than the pivot and on the right all values are greater than the pivot. Lastly, the QuickSort algorithm uses a Swap function inside the Partition function which swaps values of a list.
